# Assignment2
In this code, we implement a SingleLinkedList class that facilitates various linked list operations, including adding and removing nodes from both the front and back. Within this class, we define a Node struct that holds the data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The push_front and push_back methods are used to add elements to the beginning and end of the list, respectively. The insert method allows for adding an element at a specified index, while the remove method deletes a node based on its position. Additionally, we provide a find function that searches the list for the first occurrence of a specified item. In main.cpp, we present a basic stack implementation using a vector. We define a Stack class that stores integers in a vector. The push method adds elements to the top of the stack, while the pop method removes the top element. To retrieve the top element, we use the top function, which returns the last item in the vector. The isEmpty function checks if the stack is empty, returning true or false accordingly. Lastly, the findAverage method calculates the average value of the stack items by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of elements.
